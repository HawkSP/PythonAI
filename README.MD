# Readme.md
Here is the first stage of the Music AI project this is the gathering data stage.

## Installation

Download the git as a zip and export into a folder of choice

Since for some reason GitHub is strange it won't let me upload FFMPEG.exe, FFPLAY.EXE and FFPROBE.EXE into the repo so instead you will have to download these from them from this link:

```bash
https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z
```

Then move the 3 files into the root directory of the program (where all the python files are)


## Usage

```
[Load in pycharm for best results or any IDE that has Jupyter Notebook]
1. Open the project from file > open (the whole folder)
2. Open analysis.ipynb and run it from the beginning and it should load up a server
3. It will pop-up with a Spotify login,
4. Login to to your Spotify
5. The program will continue 
6. Check the for_analysis folder for changes
```
